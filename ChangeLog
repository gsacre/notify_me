commit ace8f914722c3116faf57b695babb382a99ba9a3
Author: Gregory SACRE <gsa@softkinetic.com>

    Added function to get a PID from a process name
    
    With this function, it is possible to get the PID from a process name.
    The goal would be to allow the user to send a process name and the
    daemon gets the name and tries to identify the PID.
    Ideally, if it finds more than one, the daemon should ask which one.
    It should also offer the option to bypass all that by giving directly a
    PID.

    Added the server side
    
    The daemon needs to start as a server to be triggered by a client.

    The command line option takes over the configuration file.

    iniparser: creation of a configuration file parsing
    
    The daemon now accepts a configuration file where it takes its
    configuration from.
    It's an INI file type:
    
    [server]
    port = 54315
    notification_timeout = 1
    
    If no configuration file is found, it takes the default values.

    Daemonize
    
    The goal is to have a kind of client-server mode so the server needs to
    run as a daemon.
    This commit performs the change to daemon.
